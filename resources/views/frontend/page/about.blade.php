                              <p class="text-color-white">Extensive background in the hospitality and tourism industry, then went on to pursue her career in Real Estate in Omeo. This led to her and husband Kim to go that extra mile and take on a business in Orbost.  Anna has 10 years' experience in Property Management and Sales and small business management. The best part is working with people and achieving happy results. Family time is precious time spent fishing, listening to music and gardening or just kicking back.</p>

                              <p class="text-color-white">It's been a pleasure working with you and I appreciate your efforts a great deal. I'll miss our emails and chats :-)</p>

                              <p class="text-color-white">I would like to express my extreme gratitude for ALL you have done for us, in the past 2 yrs. Our grateful thanks also, to both Kim & Casey as well, for their assistance when you were unable to be there.</p>

                              <p class="text-color-white">Being so far away, having someone we could trust in watching over the property in Orbost, as far as RENTING &amp; it's eventual SALE was concerned, was such a BLESSING for which we will always be grateful to you for.</p>

                              <p class="text-color-white">Your integrity &amp; supportiveness, in looking after the welfare of the home thru vetting any potential Tenant, has given us such a peace of mind, with no resulting problems to attend to & also ensured that the value of the home was maintained, throughout that time.</p>

                              <p class="text-color-white">Anna, whenever you could be, you were there to help us with any concerns &amp; a listening ear.</p>

                              <p class="text-color-white">My friend, I hope you'll always know how much that has meant to me personally &amp; to us as a family.</p>

                              <p class="text-color-white">May ALL you strive for come to fruition, in time.  May your health concerns resolve, or at the very least, be controlled enough, in order that you may have a life that, in the main, is enjoyable & worth the living, each &amp; every day.</p>

                              <p class="text-color-white">Looking forward to catching up with you when I'm next up there.</p>

                              <p class="text-color-white">Take care &amp; STAY SAFE.<br>Kindest regards ALWAYS,</p>
